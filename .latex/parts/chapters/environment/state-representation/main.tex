The default state representation for the Q*bert environment is the
\gls{rgb}-state, which is a 3-dimensional array of shape $210 \times 160 \times
3$. Since the \gls{rgb}-state is too large to be processed by a neural network,
we will use a \gls{cnn} to process the state, which will reduce the
dimensionality of the state through the use of convolutional layers.
