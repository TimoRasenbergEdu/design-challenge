As we will see in the following sections, the state representation of the
environment is a crucial aspect of the learning process. If the state
representation is too large, the learning process will be slow, and the agent
will require more samples to learn. On the other hand, if the state
representation is too small, the agent will not be able to learn the
environment's dynamics.

We will come to find that training a \gls{cnn} on the \gls{rgb}-state is
computationally expensive, and the agent will require a more samples to learn
from the environment then feasible for this project. To mitigate this issue, we
will scale down the state representation to a more manageable size. For this
scaled-down state representation, we will consider two different
representations: the \gls{rgb}-state and the grayscale-state.
