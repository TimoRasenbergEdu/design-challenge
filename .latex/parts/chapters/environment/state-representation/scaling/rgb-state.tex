As mentioned before, the \gls{rgb} state is the default representation of the
Q*bert Atari environment. The \gls{rgb} state is a three-dimensional tensor
where each dimension represents the red, green, and blue channels of the
environment, and has a size of 210x160x3, which is a large representation of
the environment. The \gls{rgb} state and its scaled down version are shown in
\cref{fig:rgb-state}.

As we see in \cref{fig:rgb-full}, the scaled down version of the \gls{rgb}
state, as shown in \cref{fig:rgb-84x84}, keeps the main features of the
environment, such as the platforms, the enemies, and the player.
